Facelift Image Replacment is a script that generates image representations of text on your web page in fonts that visitors would not be able to see.

== Description ==

FLIR for WordPress implements Facelift Image Replacement (FLIR) by Cory Mawhorter.  It is in rapid development and at this time almost completely configurable from the admin panel.  Several freeware fonts are provided with FLIR for WordPress.

FLIR for WordPress is SEO friendly and only renders the image in the browser if JavaScript is enabled.  You HTML/XHTML code remains unchanged leaving your head tags readable by search engines and the page readable by those without JavaScript.

Facelift Image Replacement (or FLIR, pronounced fleer) is an image replacement script that dynamically generates image representations of text on your web page in fonts that otherwise might not be visible to your visitors. The generated image will be automatically inserted into your web page via Javascript and visible to all modern browsers. Any element with text can be replaced: from headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to `<span>` elements and everything in between!

You can see examples of what it does here: <a href="http://facelift.mawhorter.net/examples/">http://facelift.mawhorter.net/examples/</a>

= IMPORTANT NOTES: =

If using a version prior to 0.7.0 please <em>delete</em> your existing version before installing this version =

Before running autoupdate please empty your `facelift/cache` folder.  This can be done from the plugin under FLIR for WordPress Utilities It will install and update but depending on your how long your scripts are allowed to run there is a possibility that the update will time out if you have a very large number of files in your cache.

PHP and GD. Little testing has been done with different versions of PHP. If you have PHP 5 with GD enabled you shouldn't have any problems. PHP 4 currently has some issues but should be resolved in the next release of Facelift. A newer version of ImageMagick (6.3.7+) is required for the FancyFonts and QuickEffects plugins.

If GD is not installed on your server you will have to recompile PHP to include GD. If you are comfortable in WHM for cPanel, you can do that under the "Update Apache" tab (check the "GD" box). Check your settings carefully (especially the PHP version - cPanel may try to change it) before you hit build. Plesk and ISPConfig should have GD enabled by default.  If you are not comfortable doing it yourself, ask your hosting company to do it for you. (Thanks Steve!)

1. Extract to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Look in `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift`.
3. Set the `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/config-flir.php` to be writable (`chmod a+w config-flir.php`).
4. Set the `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/cache` to be writable (`chmod a+w /cache`).
5. Add fonts of your choice to `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/fonts` folder.
6  Make sure you have the `wp_footer()` call in the footer of your template See `/wp-content/theme/default/footer.php` for example.
7. Activate plugin in WordPress admin panel
8. Set FLIR configuration in the admin panel - `config-flir.php` must be writable for changes to take effect.
9. Customize tags for FLIR on FLIR submenu under the Design menu

= Notes =

* QuickEffect Plugin is not implemented yet
* SuperCache Plugin is not implemented yet
* If using a version older than 0.7 completely delete any old verions before upgrading
* You cannot auto-upgrade from versions older 0.7.0
* Text remains intact in source so search engines see your page as text!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't work, how can I make it work? =

* Please ensure that you have a cache directory at `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/cache` and that it is writable. (`chmod a+w /cache`)
* Please ensure that your config-flir.php file exists at `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/config-flir.php` and that it is writable. (`chmod a+w config-flir.php`)
* Make sure the `wp-content/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/facelift/` is readable
* Check your theme's `footer.php` file and make sure it has the `wp_footer();` function in it.  It should be located just above the `</body>` element close tag.
* Check your theme's `header.php` file and make sure it has the `wp_head();` function in it.  It should be located just above the `</head>` element close tag.
* Check the FLIR admin panel under the design menu and make certain all the options are set in the FLIR Configuration section.  Read the help text on the right of each option for information.
* Check the FLIR admin panel under the design menu and make certain all the options you want are set in the Elements to Replace section.  Heading 1 is generally used for the blog heading, Heading 2 is used for the posts on the main page and on individual post pages, Heading 3 is often used with posts on the catagories and tags pages.  Small is often used for the date and author of the post.

= When I set FLIR to wrap the text the text overlaps on a single line, how can I fix that? =

FLIR 2.0b3 has a minor issue where the text will overlap if line-height isn't specified in your CSS file for that particular style. Adding line-height equal to the font size should correct that. For example

`a.pagetitle{`
`    font-weight:bold;`
`    font-size:24px;`
`    display:block;`
`}`

Can be updated like so to add line-height:

`a.pagetitle{`
`    font-weight:bold;`
`    font-size:24px;`
`    line-height:24px;`
`    display:block;`
`}`

= Is FLIR be configurable from the admin panel? =

FLIR is almost completely configurable from the admin panel.  Eventually it is planned to be able to configure FLIR almost completely from the admin panel.  At present to configure how and what fonts are used with flir and certain element to be replaced by FLIR.

= Will the FLIR plugins be usable? =

At present the FancyFonts plugin is implemented.  QuickEffects will be implemented next.  They require ImageMagick 6.3.7 or higher to function correctly and will be configurable from the admin panel.

= What about the fonts that come with FLIR? =

All the fonts that come with FLIR are either free or Open Source.

= What advantages would you say FLIR provides over sIFR? Besides, of course, from needing flash? =

* Facelift creates transparent PNGs which can lie over the top of any background you want.   For example, take a look at <a href="http://facelift.mawhorter.net/examples/">Example #5</a>. 
* It can easily create multi colored/font headers.  (<a href="http://facelift.mawhorter.net/examples/">Example #3</a>)
* It can replace links and maintain their clickability (though I believe this functionality was added to sIFR).
* It is very easy to implement.  No other tools besides a web browser are needed and it is very easy to maintain.
* It plays well with third party libraries such as jQuery and prototype.
* You can take advantage of plugins such as the QuickEffects plugin and add things like drop shadows and pattern/gradient fills if you have ImageMagick installed on your server.

= Is there some kind of caching system? If so, how does it work? =

Facelift caches all images it generates to disk.  It then will send appropriate headers to the browser if the image has not changed.  This allows for drastic speed increases in rendering when browsing a website.  After a couple of page views you sometimes won't even notice the text get replaced.  By default, the cached images are saved indefinitely, but you can change facelift to run through the cache every so often and remove old images to save disk space.  Just change the settings in the admin panel.

You can further improve the speed of both FLIR and WordPress in general by using a PHP accelerator which is an extension designed to boost the performance of software applications written using the PHP programming language. An example of such and accelerator is <a title="Alternative PHP Cache" href="http://pecl.php.net/package/APC">Alternative PHP Cache</a> (APC).

== Known Issues ==

* Default mode options are in the wrong location and needs to be moved.  Should be in version 0.8.7 (Thanks Zack for reminding me of this)
* Automatically updating the plugin may not work.  This is most likely caused by the cache folder files being owned by www-data rather than the account holder for the web site.  On deactivation the plugin now clears the cache folder and hopefully eliminates this issues.
* Rendering in Konqueror is incorrect and displays all rendered text as the default size and black.

== Upcoming Features ==

* Supercache option ~v0.9
* QuickEffects (requires ImageMagick) ~v0.9.5
* More...

== Under consideration ==

* Uploading of fonts from within the plugin

== Development Version ==

* Always the latest code
* Please remove existing version before installing the development version
