Unicode bug?
============

Some people are still reporting an issue with unicode but I am unable to reproduce it locally.  If you have a problem, please head to http://forums.mawhorter.net/ and report it in the Bugs section.


Major and Minor Fixes
=====================

This version fixes some major and minor problems with the previous beta.  For details of what has been fixed, head to the forums and look for posts that start with "[Fixed 2.0]"

The most notable fix was the problem with cropped lines and characters.  If you are using PHP 5.2.10 or 5.3 and still experiencing this problem, it may be due to a bug in PHP.  See the forums for details.


FLIR Lite
=========

Included with this release is FLIR Lite (7kb).  When gzipped it is ~4kb.  This is a scaled down and reduced in size version for people who don't need all the extras that the full version of FLIR offers.  If you just need to replace headers with text and don't need anything fancy, use FLIR Lite.  FLIR Lite does not include things like hover support or plugins.
